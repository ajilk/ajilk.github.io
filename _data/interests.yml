    I am all about creation of something from nothing (no wonder why I am
    into CS). It started with sketching anything that was visible to my eyes
    then continued into writing about anything my little brain can comprehend
    or most of the time about what I do not understand. I also enjoy playing
    the piano and cubing on my free time.

    I enjoy challenging myself physically. I have done TaeKwonDo and Muay Thai.
    Tricking is also another interest of mine since it involves greater risk.
