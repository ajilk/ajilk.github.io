        I wish I can tell you there is something different about me, but I am
        just another one. Another human being who is aimlessly wondering around
        trying to figure it out the reason behind this existence. The reasons
        might reveal itself the moment I take my last breath. It might possibly
        never reveal itself. But it is all fine with me. Search for meaning has
        been set as my life goal to prevent me from going insane.
      </h3>
      <h4>
        Technology has been the path for me at the moment. I have made it my
        focus to use technology to improve if not save lives. I have taken
        the <a href="/projects/">first step </a>(I think).
